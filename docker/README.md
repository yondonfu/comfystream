# ComfyStream Docker

This folder contains the Docker files that can be used to run ComfyStream in a containerized fashion or to work on the codebase within a dev container. This README contains the general usage instructions while the [Devcontainer Readme](../.devcontainer/README.md) contains instructions on how to use Comfystream inside a dev container and get quickly started with your development journey.

## Containers

- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) - The main Dockerfile that can be used to run ComfyStream in a containerized fashion.
- [Dockerfile.base](Dockerfile.base) - The base Dockerfile that can be used to build the base image for ComfyStream.

## Pre-requisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

docker build -t livepeer/comfystream -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Container

To start the container in interactive mode, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --gpus all livepeer/comfystream
```

To start the Comfystream server, run the following command:

```bash
docker run --gpus all livepeer/comfystream --server
