# Dev Container Setup for ComfyStream

This guide will help you set up and run a development container for ComfyStream using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [VS Code Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Host Setup

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the `comfystream` repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yondonfu/comfystream.git
cd comfystream
```

### Download or Build Base Docker Image

The `livepeer/comfyui-base:latest` image provides a ComfyUI workspace for ComfyStream development. You may either pull the base docker image or build it:

- Pull from Dockerhub:

```sh
docker pull livepeer/comfyui-base:latest
```

- Build the base image:

```sh
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.base -t livepeer/comfyui-base:latest .
```

### Host Configuration

On your **host** system, create directories to store models and engines:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/models/ComfyUI--models && mkdir -p ~/models/ComfyUI--output
```

> [!NOTE]
> This step should be ran on your host machine before attempting to start the container.

If you would like to use a different path to store models, open `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file and update the `source` to map to the correct paths to your host system. Here is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "mounts": [
    "source=/path/to/your/model-files,target=/ComfyUI/models/ComfyUI--models,type=bind",
    "source=/path/to/your/output-files,target=/ComfyUI/models/ComfyUI--output,type=bind"
  ]
}
```

Replace `/path/to/your/model-files` and `path/to/your/output-files` with the path to your `models` and `output` folders on your host machine.

## Dev Container Setup

1. Open the `comfystream` repository in VS Code.
2. From VS Code, reload the folder as a devcontainer:
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
   - Select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.

### Download models

From within the **dev container**, download models to run the example workflows:

```sh
cd /comfystream
conda activate comfystream
python src/comfystream/scripts/setup_models.py --workspace /ComfyUI
```

For more info about configuring model downloads, see [src/comfystream/scripts/README.md](../src/comfystream/scripts/README.md)

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run your development container for ComfyStream efficiently.

### Building the DepthAnything Engine

After downloading models, it is necessary to compile TensorRT engines for the example workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> Engine files must be compiled on the same GPU hardware/architecture that they will be used on. This step must be run manually after starting the devcontainer. You may use either conda environment for this step.

1. Run the **export_trt.py** script from the directory of the onnx file:

    ```sh
    cd /ComfyUI/models/tensorrt/depth-anything
    python /ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Depth-Anything-Tensorrt/export_trt.py
    ```

## Debugging ComfyStream and ComfyUI

The `launch.json` includes sample launch configurations for ComfyStream and ComfyUI.

## Setting the Python Environment

Conda is initialized in the bash shell with no environment activated to provide better interoperability with VS Code Shell Integration.

VS Code will automatically activate the `comfystream` environment, unless you change it:

1. From VSCode, press `Ctrl-Shift-P`.
2. Choose `Python: Select Interpreter`.
3. Select `comfystream` or `comfyui`.
4. Open a new terminal, you will see the environment name to the left of the bash terminal.

Alternatively, you may activate an environment manually with `conda activate comfyui` or `conda activate comfystream`

> [!NOTE] For more information, see [Python environments in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)

### Starting ComfyUI

Start ComfyUI:

```sh
cd /comfystream/ComfyUI
conda activate comfyui
python main.py --listen
```

When using TensorRT engine enabled workflows, you should include the `---disable-cuda-malloc` flag as shown below:

```sh
cd /comfystream/ComfyUI
conda activate comfyui
python main.py --listen --disable-cuda-malloc
```

### Starting ComfyStream

Start ComfyStream:

```sh
cd /comfystream
conda activate comfystream
python server/app.py --workspace /ComfyUI --media-ports=5678 --host=0.0.0.0 --port 8888
```

Optionally, you can also start the [ComfyStream UI](../README.md#run-ui) to view the stream:

```sh
cd /comfystream/ui
npm run dev:https
```
